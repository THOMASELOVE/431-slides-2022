## Instructions for the Quick Survey

Please read these instructions **before** writing.

1. Introduce yourself to someone that you don't know.
2. Record the survey answers **for that other person**, while they record your responses.
3. Be sure to complete all 15 questions (both sides.)
4. When you are finished, thank your partner and raise your hand. Someone will come to collect your survey.

Regarding Question 4, Professor Love is the large fellow standing in the front of the room.

## Today's Agenda

- Data Structures and Variables
- Evaluating some of the Survey variables
- Using R to look at a little data
- Guessing Dr. Love's Age

## Chatfield's Six Rules for Data Analysis

1. Do not attempt to analyze the data until you understand what is being measured and why.
2. Find out how the data were collected.
3. Look at the structure of the data.
4. Carefully examine the data in an exploratory way, before attempting a more sophisticated analysis.
5. Use your common sense at all times.
6. Report the results in a clear, self-explanatory way.

## Our Quick Survey

![](c02/images/survey_form.png)

## Types of Data

The key distinction we'll make is between

- **quantitative** (numerical) and
- **categorical** (qualitative) information.

Information that is quantitative describes a **quantity**. 

- All quantitative variables have units of measurement.
- Quantitative variables are recorded in numbers, and we use them as numbers (for instance, taking a mean of the variable makes some sense.)

## Continuous vs. Discrete Quantities

**Continuous** variables (can take any value in a range) vs. **Discrete** variables (limited set of potential values)

- Is Height a continuous or a discrete variable?

:::{.incremental}
  - Height is certainly continuous as a concept, but how precise is our ruler?
  - Piano vs. Violin
:::

## Quantitative Variable Subtypes

We can also distinguish **interval** (equal distance between values, but zero point is arbitrary) from **ratio** variables (meaningful zero point.)

:::{.incremental}
  - Is Weight an interval or ratio variable? 
  - How about IQ?
:::

## Qualitative (Categorical) Data

Qualitative variables consist of names of categories.

- Each possible value is a code for a category (could use numerical or non-numerical codes.)
  - **Binary** categorical variables (two categories, often labeled 1 or 0)
  - **Multi-categorical** variables (three or more categories)
- Can distinguish *nominal* (no underlying order) vs. *ordinal* (categories are ordered.)

## Some Categorical Variables

- How is your overall health? <br /> (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor)
- Which candidate would you vote for if the election were held today?
- Did this patient receive this procedure?
- If you needed to analyze a small data set right away, which of the following software tools would you be comfortable using to accomplish that task?

## Are these quantitative or categorical?

1. Do you **smoke**? (1 = Non-, 2 = Former, 3 = Smoker)
2. How much did you pay for your most recent **haircut**? (in $)
3. What is your favorite **color**?
4. How many hours did you **sleep** last night?
5. Statistical thinking in your future **career**? (1 = Not at all important to 7 = Extremely important)

- If quantitative, are they *discrete* or *continuous*? Do they have a meaningful *zero point*?
- If categorical, how many categories? *Nominal* or *ordinal*?

## Ingesting the Quick Surveys

![](c02/images/2019_setup.png)

## The Quick Survey

315 people took (essentially) the same survey in the same way.

Fall | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | Total
----: | ----: |----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | -----: | -----:
*n* | 61 | 51 | 48 | 64 | 49 | 42 | **315**

### Question

About how many of those 315 surveys caused *no problems* in recording responses?

## The 15 Survey Items

\#  | Topic         | \#  | Topic
--: | -----------   | --: | -----------
Q1 | `glasses`      | Q9  | `lectures_vs_activities`
Q2 | `english`      | Q10 | `projects_alone`
Q3 | `stats_so_far` | Q11 | `height`
Q4 | `guess_TL_ht`  | Q12 | `hand_span`
Q5 | `smoke`        | Q13 | `color`
Q6 | `handedness`   | Q14 | `sleep`
Q7 | `stats_future` | Q15 | `pulse_rate`
Q8 | `haircut`      | -   | -


- At one time, I asked about `sex` rather than `glasses`.
- In prior years, people guessed my age, rather than height here.
- Sometimes, I've asked for a 30-second pulse check, then doubled.

## Response to the Question I asked

About how many of those 315 surveys caused *no problems* in recording responses?

> - Guesses?

> - 110/315 (35%) caused no problems.

## Guess My Age

What should we do in these cases?

## English best language?

## Height

## Handedness Scale (2016-21 version)

## Favorite color

## Following the Rules?

# What Happens Next?

## The R Packages I'll Load Today

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

library(janitor)
library(googlesheets4)
library(patchwork)
library(tidyverse)
```

- If you actually run this in R, you will get some messages which we will suppress and ignore today.

## More to come.

Soon.

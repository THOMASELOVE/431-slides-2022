# Working with Larger Cross-Tabulations

## A $2 \times 3$ contingency table

This table displays the count of patients who show *complete*, *partial*, or *no response* after treatment with either **active** medication or a **placebo** in a study of 100 patients...

Group | None | Partial | Complete
-----:| :---:| :----: | :-----:
Active | 8 | 24 | 20
Placebo | 12 | 26 | 10

Is there a statistically detectable association here, at $\alpha = 0.10$? 

## The Pearson Chi-Square Test

- $H_0$: Response Distribution is the same, regardless of Treatment.
- $H_A$: There is an association between Treatment and Response.

The Pearson $\chi^2$ test assumes the null hypothesis is true (rows and columns are independent.) That is a model for our data. How does it work? 

## Calculating Chi-Square

Here's the table, with marginal totals added.

-- | None | Partial | Complete | **TOTAL**
-------- | ------: | -----: | -----: | -----:
Active   | 8 | 24 | 20 | **52**
Placebo  | 12 | 26 | 10 | **48**
**TOTAL** | **20** | **50** | **30** | **100**

The test needs to estimate the expected frequency in each of the six cells under the assumption of independence. If the rows and columns were independent, what is the expected count in the Active/None cell?

## The Independence Model

-- | None | Partial | Complete | **TOTAL**
---------: | ------: | -----: | -----: | -----:
Active | -- | -- | -- | **52**
Placebo | -- | -- | -- | **48**
**TOTAL** | **20** | **50** | **30** | **100**

If the rows and columns were independent, then: 

- 20/100 of subjects would have response = "None"
    - That's 20% of the 52 Active, and 20% of the 48 Placebo
- 50% would have a "Partial" response, and 
- 30% would have a "Complete" response in each group.

## Observed (*Expected*) Cell Counts

So, can we fill in the expected frequencies under our independence model?

-- | None | Partial | Complete | **TOTAL**
-------- | :------: | :-----: | :-----: | -----:
Active   | 8 (*10.4*) | 24 (*26.0*) | 20 (*15.6*) | **52**
Placebo  | 12 (*9.6*) | 26 (*24.0*) | 10 (*14.4*) | **48**
**TOTAL** | **20** | **50** | **30** | **100**

## General Formula for Expected Frequencies under Independence

$$ 
\mbox{Expected Frequency} = \frac{\mbox{Row total} \times \mbox{Column total}}{\mbox{Grand Total}}
$$

This assumes that the independence model holds: the probability of being in a particular column is exactly the same in each row, and vice versa.

## Chi-Square Assumptions

- Expected Frequencies: We assume that the expected frequency, under the null hypothesized model of independence, will be **at least 5** (and ideally at least 10) in each cell. If that is not the case, then the $\chi^2$ test is likely to give unreliable results. 
- The *Cochran conditions* require us to have no cells with zero counts **and** at least 80% of the cells in our table with expected counts of 5 or higher. That's what R uses to warn you of trouble.
- Don't meet the standards? Consider collapsing categories.

## Observed (**Expected**) Cell Counts (again)

-- | None | Partial | Complete | **TOTAL**
-------- | :------: | :-----: | :-----: | -----:
Active   | 8 (**10.4**) | 24 (**26.0**) | 20 (**15.6**) | 52
Placebo  | 12 (**9.6**) | 26 (**24.0**) | 10 (**14.4**) | 48
TOTAL | 20 | 50 | 30 | 100

- Do we meet the Cochran conditions in this case?

## Getting the Table into R

We'll put the table into a matrix in R. Here's one approach...

```{r}
#| echo: true
T1 <- matrix(c(8, 24, 20, 12, 26, 10), 
             ncol=3, nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
rownames(T1) <- c("Active", "Placebo")
colnames(T1) <- c("None", "Partial", "Complete")
T1
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
chisq.test(T1)
```


## Chi-Square Test Results in R

- $H_0$: Response Distribution is the same, regardless of Treatment.
    - Rows and Columns of the table are *independent*
- $H_A$: There is an association between Treatment and Response.
    - Rows and Columns of the table are *associated*.

- For our T1, the results were: $\chi^2$ = 4.0598, df = 2, *p* = 0.1313

What is the conclusion?

## Does Sample Size Affect The $\chi^2$ Test?

- T1 results were: $\chi^2$ = 4.0598, df = 2, *p* = 0.1313
- What if we had the same pattern, but twice as much data?

```{r}
#| echo: true
T1_doubled <- T1*2
T1_doubled
chisq.test(T1_doubled)
```

## Can we run Fisher's exact test instead?

Yes, but ... if the Pearson assumptions don't hold, then the Fisher's test is not generally an improvement. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
fisher.test(T1)
```

- It's also really meant more for square tables, with the same number of rows as columns, and relatively modest sample sizes.

## OK. Back to `dm1000` (see Class 8)

```{r}
#| echo: true
dm1000 <- read_rds("c21/data/dm_1000.Rds") |>
    select(subject, tobacco, insurance) |>
    drop_na()

head(dm1000)
```

## Arrange the Factors in a Useful Order

```{r}
#| echo: true
dm1000 <- dm1000 |>
    mutate(tobacco = 
               fct_relevel(tobacco, "Current", "Former"),
           insurance = 
               fct_relevel(insurance, "Medicare", 
                           "Commercial", "Medicaid"))

dm1000 |> tabyl(tobacco, insurance) |> 
    adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col"))
```

## dm1000: Two Categorical Variables of interest

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
p1 <- ggplot(dm1000, aes(x = insurance)) + geom_bar() + 
    geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", 
              vjust = 1.5, col = "white")

p2 <- ggplot(dm1000, aes(x = tobacco)) + geom_bar() + 
    geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", 
              vjust = 1.5, col = "white")

p1 + p2 
```

## A $4 \times 3$ table with the `dm1000` data

```{r}
#| echo: true

dm1000 |> 
    tabyl(insurance, tobacco) |>
    adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col"))
```

## Plotting a Cross-Tabulation?

```{r}
#| echo: true

ggplot(dm1000, aes(x = insurance, y = tobacco)) +
    geom_count() 
```

## Tobacco Bar Chart faceted by Insurance

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

ggplot(dm1000, aes(x = tobacco, fill = tobacco)) + 
    geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ insurance) +
    guides(fill = "none") + 
    geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", 
              vjust = 1, col = "black")
```

## Tobacco Status and Insurance in `dm1000`

- $H_0$: Insurance type and Tobacco status are independent
- $H_A$: Insurance type and Tobacco status have a detectable association

Pearson $\chi^2$ results?

```{r}
#| echo: true

dm1000 |> tabyl(insurance, tobacco) |> chisq.test()
```

Can we check our expected frequencies?

## Checking Expected Frequencies

```{r}
#| echo: true

res <- dm1000 |> tabyl(insurance, tobacco) |> chisq.test()

res$observed
res$expected
```

Any problems with Cochran conditions?

## Mosaic Plot for Cross-Tabulation

Each rectangle's area is proportional to the number of cases in that cell.

```{r}
#| echo: true

plot(dm1000$insurance, dm1000$tobacco, ylab = "", xlab = "")
```

## Mosaic Plot from the `vcd` package (highlighting)

```{r}
#| echo: true

mosaic(~ tobacco + insurance, data = dm1000, 
       highlighting = "tobacco", 
       highlighting_fill = c("red", "gray50", "white"))
```

## Mosaic Plot from the `vcd` package (with $\chi^2$ shading)

```{r}
#| echo: true
mosaic(~ tobacco + insurance, data = dm1000, shade = TRUE)
```

# P values: What's the problem?

## Roger Peng's description of a successful data analysis

> A data analysis is successful if the audience to which it is presented accepts the results.

So what makes a data analysis more believable / more acceptable?

Lazar (2019) [Moving to a World Beyond "p < 0.05"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913), *The American Statistician*, 73:sup1, 1-19, DOI: [10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913). 

## Statistical Inference in the 21st Century

> ... a world learning to venture beyond "p < 0.05"

> This is a world where researchers are free to treat "p = 0.051" and "p = 0.049" as not being categorically different, where authors no longer find themselves constrained to selectively publish their results based on a single magic number. 

## Statistical Inference in the 21st Century

> In this world, where studies with "p < 0.05" and studies with "p > 0.05" are not automatically in conflict, researchers will see their results more easily replicated -- and, even when not, they will better understand why.

> The 2016 ASA Statement on P-Values and Statistical Significance started moving us toward this world. As of the date of publication of this special issue, the statement has been viewed over 294,000 times and cited over 1700 times-an average of about 11 citations per week since its release. Now we must go further.

## The American Statistical Association Statement on P values and Statistical Significance

The ASA Statement (2016) was mostly about what **not** to do.

The 2019 effort represents an attempt to explain what to do.

## ASA 2019 Statement

> Some of you exploring this special issue of The American Statistician might be wondering if it's a scolding from pedantic statisticians lecturing you about what not to dowith p-values, without
offering any real ideas of what to do about the very hard problem of separating signal from noise in data and making decisions under uncertainty. Fear not. In this issue, thanks to 43 innovative
and thought-provoking papers from forward-looking statisticians, help is on the way.

## "Don't" is not enough. 

> If you're just arriving to the debate, here's a sampling of what not to do.

- Don't base your conclusions solely on whether an association or effect was found to be "statistically significant" (i.e., the *p* value passed some arbitrary threshold such as p < 0.05).
- Don't believe that an association or effect exists just because it was statistically significant.

## "Don't" is not enough. 

- Don't believe that an association or effect is absent just because it was not statistically significant.
- Don't believe that your p-value gives the probability that chance alone produced the observed association or effect or the probability that your test hypothesis is true.
- Don't conclude anything about scientific or practical importance based on statistical significance (or lack thereof).

## One More Don't...

![](c21/figures/ASA2019_1.png)

> A label of statistical significance adds nothing to what is already conveyed by the value of *p*; in fact, this dichotomization of *p*-values makes matters worse.

## Problems with *p* Values

1. *P* values are inherently unstable
2. The *p* value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result
3. Scientific conclusions should not be based only on whether a *p* value passes a specific threshold
4. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency
5. By itself, a *p* value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis

<http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2546529>

## Solutions to the *P* Value Problems

1. Estimation of the Size of the Effect
2. Precision of the Estimate (Confidence Intervals)
3. Inference About the Target Population
4. Determination of Whether the Results Are Compatible With a Clinically Meaningful Effect
5. Replication and Steady Accumulation of Knowledge

<http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2546529>

## JAMA Otolaryngology: Head & Neck Surgery {.smaller}

> ... we look to publish original investigations where the investigators planned the study with sufficient sample size to have adequate power to detect a clinically meaningful effect and report the results with effect sizes and CIs. Authors should interpret the effect sizes in relation to previous research and use CIs to help determine whether the results are compatible with clinically meaningful effects. 

> We acknowledge that no single study can define truth and that the advancement of medical knowledge and patient care depends on the steady accumulation of reliable clinical information.

<http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2546529>

## The Value of a *p*-Valueless Paper {.smaller}

Abstract: As is common in current bio-medical research, about 85% of original contributions in *The American Journal of Gastroenterology* in 2004 have reported *p*-values. However, none are reported in this issue's article by Abraham et al. who, instead, rely exclusively on effect size estimates and associated confidence intervals to summarize their findings. **Authors using confidence intervals communicate much more information in a clear and efficient manner than those using** *p*-**values. This strategy also prevents readers from drawing erroneous conclusions caused by common misunderstandings about** *p*-**values**. I outline how standard, two-sided confidence intervals can be used to measure whether two treatments differ or test whether they are clinically equivalent.

# Dividing Data Comparisons into Categories based on p values

## Regina Nuzzo: *Nature* Statistical Errors

![](c21/figures/Probable_Cause.jpg)

## Gelman on *p* values, 1

> The common practice of dividing data comparisons into categories based on significance levels is terrible, but it happens all the time.... so it's worth examining the prevalence of this error. Consider, for example, this division: 

- "really significant" for *p* < .01, 
- "significant" for *p* < .05, 
- "marginally significant" for *p* < .1, and 
- "not at all significant" otherwise. 

## Gelman on *p* values, 2

Now consider some typical *p*-values in these ranges: say, *p* = .005, *p* = .03, *p* = .08, and *p* = .2. 

Translate these two-sided *p*-values back into z-scores...

Description | really sig. | sig. | marginally sig.| not at all sig.
---------: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----:
*p* value | 0.005 | 0.03 | 0.08 | 0.20
Z score | 2.8 | 2.2 | 1.8 | 1.3

## Gelman on *p* values, 3

The seemingly yawning gap in p-values comparing the not at all significant *p*-value of .2 to the really significant *p*-value of .005, is only a z score of 1.5. 

If you had two independent experiments with z-scores of 2.8 and 1.3 and with equal standard errors and you wanted to compare them, you'd get a difference of 1.5 with a standard error of 1.4, which is completely consistent with noise.

## Gelman on *p* values, 4

From a **statistical** point of view, the trouble with using the p-value as a data summary is that the p-value can only be interpreted in the context of the null hypothesis of zero effect, and (much of the time), nobody's interested in the null hypothesis. 

Indeed, once you see comparisons between large, marginal, and small effects, the null hypothesis is irrelevant, as you want to be comparing effect sizes.

## Gelman on *p* values, 5

From a **psychological** point of view, the trouble with using the p-value as a data summary is that this is a kind of deterministic thinking, an attempt to convert real uncertainty into firm statements that are just not possible (or, as we would say now, just not replicable).

**The key point**: The difference between statistically significant and NOT statistically significant is not, generally, statistically significant.

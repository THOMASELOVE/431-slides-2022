# 431-slides-2022

This is the repository for Dr. Love's class slides for 431 in Fall 2022.

The main page for the course is https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/

- The **HTML Link to Slides** provides the version of the slides I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Quarto file links provide the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides.
